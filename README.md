## Downloading and Setup for Development:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone --recursive <git URI>`.
2. Execute `npm install`. This will install the required dependencies for the project.
3. To run the project in a local server, execute `npm run start`. This runs the project in a local webpack-dev server. It should automatically open the url in a browser window.
